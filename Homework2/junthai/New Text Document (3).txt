What is kinship?

Kinship is having or sharing the aspects relating to an individuals heritage or origin. This could be in forms of cultural practices, beliefs, values, or any aspects that help individuals shape their identities.


What are some of the ways we can try to know what childhood was like for enslaved children? What can we learn from them? What can't we learn?

Ways that we can try to know what childhood was like for enslaved children are books, articles, autobiographies, podcasts, audio recordings of the past, stories of people whop grew up during that period of time. From these experiences, we can learn the harsh nature and environment that enslaved children grew up in. We can also understand how their minds worked since majority of enslaved children were separated from the family. Therefore, hearing their experiences would give other people more awareness of what it is like to cut ties with their kinship and be isolated from family. What we can't learn from this is the fully accurate experiences of the childhood for enslaved children because most of the resources are flawed. This makes sense because most of these people who grew up during this period do not want to recall traumatic memories.
